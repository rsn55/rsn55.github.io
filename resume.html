      <ul>
        <li>Governor's School is a five week summer residential program for intellectually gifted high school students. <a href="http://www.ncgovschool.org/overview/" target="_blank">Read more.</a></li>
        <li>I was selected to study at the Meredith College campus with a concentration in mathematics. Along with a couple non-math classes, I took mini-courses in non-Euclidean geometry, quantum computing, and combinatorics.</li>
        <li>My research group chose to focus on learning basic topological concepts through knot theory. Primary topics of our research included methods of transformation and simplification (Reidemeister moves) and determining non-equivalency of knots with tri-colorability, Kaufman's bracket polynomial, and the Jones polynomial. At the end of the summer, we presented a summary of our efforts and findings to an audience of 100, with a focus on simplification for beginner understanding.<a href="http://prezi.com/pdh2duilzwct/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy" target="_blank"> View my presentation</a>.
